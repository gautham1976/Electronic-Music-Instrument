The composer controls the electronic component in such music, and the sounds are created or altered electronically. Electronic instruments include those, like the electric guitar, that produce sound acoustically or mechanically but magnify it electrically or electronically. However, both their design and the sound they produce are frequently quite similar to those of their non-electronic equivalents.
